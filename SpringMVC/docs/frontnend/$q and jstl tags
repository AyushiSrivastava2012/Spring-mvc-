1. $q.defer():
referred to this tutorial:
http://www.tothenew.com/blog/angularjs-deferred-promises-basic-understanding/

By the definition,  Promise is an interface which represents a proxy value. ie. We don’t know the value at the time it’s created.
This promise will return value like any synchronous function in future. There can be several states for a promise.
pending: initial state, not fulfilled/rejected.
fulfilled: successful operation
rejected: failed operation.
settled: the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.

Promise In Angularjs- $q Service

Promises in AngularJS is provided by $q service. It has reach feature like any other Promise library. $q service is a service that helps you
to run your code asynchronously.
Deferred Object:
Deferred is an object which exposes the promise. It has  mainly three methods resolve(), reject(), and notify(). Deferred returns promise
object. When Deferred completes, You call methods either resolve(), reject(), and notify() . It calls callback register to either resolve(),
reject(), or notify() according to how it has completed.
Example:
function sayHelloAsync(name) {
    return function () {
        var defer = $q.defer()
        setTimeout(function() {
            //Greet when your name is 'deepak'
            if (name == 'deepak') {
                defer.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
            }
            else {
                defer.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
            }
        }, 1000);

        return defer.promise
    }


A promise is an object which is return by a Deferred object. You can register different callbacks for different events resolve(), reject(),
 or notify() and it will execute when the async function has completed.

 Deferred API:
A new instance of defer is created by calling $q.defer(). It has mainly three methods.
.resolve(value) – This method is use to resolve the derive promise ie. // promise fulfilled -ve
.reject(value) – This method is use to reject the derived promise ie. // promise fulfilled -ve
.notify(value) – This method is used to notify the current state of the derived promise

Promise API
A new promise is created when you create a defer. You can get the instance of promise object by defer.promise. It is used to getting the result of the defer when a
 promise has completed. There are three events where you can bind your listeners.
then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)- The Regardless promise is resolved or rejected, it calls one of the success or error
 callback. Notification callback may be called zero or more than one time.
catch(errorCallback)- This is the shorthand for the promise.then(null, errorCallback) where success callback is not given.
finally(callback, notifyCallback)- This allows you to watch every single event of a promise. The callback is called once when either
 promise is resolved or rejected.


 $q.all() : $q.all accepts array of promises as argument. Once all of the promises get
 completed. you will get the result in callback function as array of results.

var promise1 = $http({method: 'GET', url: '/api-one-url', cache: 'true'});
var promise2 = $http({method: 'GET', url: '/api-two-url', cache: 'true'});

$q.all([promise1, promise2])
    .then(function(data){
        console.log(data[0], data[1]);
    });


2.JSTL tags-
The JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) represents a set of tags to simplify the JSP development.
There JSTL mainly provides 5 types of tags:

Tag Name		Description
Core tags		The JSTL core tag provide variable support, URL management, flow control etc. The url for the core tag is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core . The prefix of core tag is c.
Function tags	The functions tags provide support for string manipulation and string length. The url for the functions tags is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions and prefix is fn.
Formatting tags	The Formatting tags provide support for message formatting, number and date formatting etc. The url for the Formatting tags is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt and prefix is
				fmt.
XML tags		The xml sql tags provide flow control, transformation etc. The url for the xml tags is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/xml and prefix is x.
SQL tags		The JSTL sql tags provide SQL support. The url for the sql tags is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql and prefix is sql.

c:out	It display the result of an expression, similar to the way <%=...%> tag work.
c:import	It Retrives relative or an absolute URL and display the contents to either a String in 'var',a Reader in 'varReader' or the page.
c:set	It sets the result of an expression under evaluation in a 'scope' variable.
c:remove	It is used for removing the specified scoped variable from a particular scope.
c:catch	It is used for Catches any Throwable exceptions that occurs in the body.
c:if	It is conditional tag used for testing the condition and display the body content only if the expression evaluates is true.
c:choose, c:when, c:otherwise	It is the simple conditional tag that includes its body content if the evaluated condition is true.
c:forEach	It is the basic iteration tag. It repeats the nested body content for fixed number of times or over collection.
c:forTokens	It iterates over tokens which is separated by the supplied delimeters.
c:param	It adds a parameter in a containing 'import' tag's URL.
c:redirect	It redirects the browser to a new URL and supports the context-relative URLs.
c:url	It creates a URL with optional query parameters.
